                This project started my experience with using HTML and C++. I was on the frontend team for our cybersecurity class
                and we had to develop a website that would test senior citizens' ability to recognize scams. My job was to make a splash page.

            Involved in the Computer Science Software and Engineering Club (CSSEC) as treasurer. During my time at CSSEC, I helped 
            organize our club's first hackathon. I ordered shirts for the event, after obtaining a quote from a T-shirt vendor. 
            For our 2025 hackathon, I will be involved in the budgeting committee and the logistics committee. Within these committees I will help build the event 
            schedule and manage catering.

        <h2>Relevant Course Work</h2>
        <Article>
            Throughout my journey at FGCU, the courses where I learned the most are Computer Security, Systems Administration and Programming, 
            and Software Engineering Fundamentals. In Computer Security, I learned about using Linux Systems. I also learned about various hacking scenarios and how to defind against them:
            DOS attacks, packet spoofing, and packet sniffing. We also learned about internet protocols. In Systems Administration, I went more in-depth into the Linux Operating System.
            I learned about setting up servers like NFS and FTP. In Software Engineering Fundamentals I have learned about different software engineering methodologies
            like agile, waterfall, and spiral. Lastly, I have learned about using .git for version control.
